Challenges Faced:
State Management in React: One of the main challenges was managing the state of the birthday list as users add, edit, and remove birthdays. Ensuring the UI updated correctly after any change required careful handling of state in React.

Handling Date Formats: Another challenge was dealing with different date formats and ensuring the birthdays were displayed correctly, especially when considering time zone differences and ensuring correct sorting.

Responsive Design: Ensuring the app was mobile-friendly and properly responsive was also a challenge, particularly in making sure the layout adapts well to different screen sizes.

Persistent Data: Implementing a way to persist birthday data even after the page is reloaded was a bit tricky. This was solved by using the browser's local storage to save the list of birthdays.

Future Improvements
User Authentication: Adding login/signup functionality to allow users to save their birthdays permanently.
Notifications: Implementing email or push notifications for birthday reminders.
Better UI/UX Design: Enhancing the visual appearance of the app to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing.
